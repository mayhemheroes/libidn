  # Autopoint and libtoolize copy M4 macros into AC_CONFIG_MACRO_DIR
  # which is lib/m4 in this project.  The ./bootstrap script copies
  # gnulib's M4 macros into gl/m4 and lib/gl/m4 respectively.
  #
  # The M4 files from gnulib must be preferred over the files from
  # autopoint and libtoolize.  Otherwise you get build errors, since
  # gnulib (other M4 macros and the *.in.h header file stubs) assume
  # they are using the gnulib M4 macros.  It may be possible to solve
  # this with clever ordering of aclocal -I's but then you would still
  # have multiple versions of the same M4 macro in the tarball.
  #
  # In most projects, the M4 files from one single gnulib-tool
  # instance would overwrite all autopoint/libtoolize M4 files, and
  # then you would use that m4-base as the AC_CONFIG_MACRO_DIR value
  # and everything would work.
  #
  # In this project it happens that some M4 files are put in gl/m4/
  # and some in lib/gl/m4/ and that neither directory contains a
  # strict superset of the M4 files that were copied into lib/m4/.
  #
  # The following is a generic solution to make sure any
  # autopoint/libtoolize M4 macros are not used, but instead the
  # version from gnulib ends up being used.
  #
  # This seem like a hack, so other solutions are welcome.
